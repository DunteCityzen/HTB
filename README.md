# WELCOME TO MY JUNKYARD

In this repo you'll find the remnants of my efforts to pwn hack the box machines. Just the stuff I cook up to help me pwn machines and sometimes python scripts to automate some tasks.



**DICLAIMER**: I'm no guru nor a geek CTF player. Just started doing it recently for fun.



With that out the way, feel free to look at how I approach the following labs, solve them, document the things I learn on the way, the tools, scripts, payloads I used as well as any interesting information I collected along the way.



This are just  the things I used, learned and created.
